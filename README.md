# Assassin Game

Utilizing Bluetooth, Beacons and GPS services, Assassin Game makes the user see players in the same room in a real map. Once a hunter or a target is nearby, the user will see notifications and then make decisions to escape or kill the prey. The user can check information about him or herself and other players in that room at any time. The last one in that room who has not been killed will be the winner.
 
 
## Using the App

* Enter username and roomname and wait for other people to join. The username should be at 4 bytes long and the roomname should be at least 3 bytes long. Then a timer fragment will show. The user has five minutes to wait for any other players to join and start the game. 

* After the game is successfully started, the user will enter a lobby, where the information of all the users in that room are listed. The map fragment shows the instant location of every user in that room in a Google map. The user can also check stats about him or herself in the Me fragment. 

* Once a hunter or a target is nearby, the user will receive notifications and then make decisions to escape or kill the prey. This can be done at the same time. The user can kill the prey by hitting the "Kill" button in the target fragment when the target is detected as "in range".

* The game continues. Once the user has been killed, he or she will be marked "dead" in the map and will not be able to do anything; The game ends when there is only one player alive in that room.
